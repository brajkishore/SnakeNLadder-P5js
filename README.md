# SnakeNLadder-P5js
Snake and Ladder game, extendable to multi-players using P5Js and ES6
Prerequites to run the application:
Install npm and then install p5js library
1. npm install -g p5-manager (will install most of the dependent library)
2. p5 new <CollectionName> (will create a collection for multiple projects)
3. p5 generate <projectName> (will create a project directory and configure default settings)
4. cd to above project directory and run below command
5. p5 server (will run the project on http://localhost:5555)

I am newbiee to p5js and there might be error in code (at least lots to refactor and handle all corner cases) but this can be a good to go overview.
Must refer below links.
